                                Cookies are baked sweets made mostly from flour, sugar, and fat (usually butter). They come in a huge range of textures,
                                from soft and chewy to crispy and crunchy, depending on ingredients and baking time.

                                Cookies started in 7th-century Persia, where sugar was first widely used. As trade grew, the idea spread to Europe by the Middle Ages,
                                where cookies became popular because they stayed fresh and were easy to carry on long trips. In the 1600s, Dutch settlers brought cookies to North America,
                                where the name evolved from the Dutch word <em>koekje</em> (“little cake”). By the 19th and 20th centuries, improved ovens and ingredients helped create
                                the modern cookie styles we know today. Finally, in the 1930s, the invention of the chocolate chip cookie kicked off the era of creative cookie
                                variations and mass-produced favorites.

                                I actually don't often eat cookies, not at all! But when I do, I really like the crunchiness
                                of the caramelized dough, but also the softness of some other types of cookies, it really varies!
                                And I have a thing for sweet stuff, though I try to hold myself back, so of course I like sweet cookies the most!
